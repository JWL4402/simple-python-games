# simple-python-games
A collection of simple games written in Python using PyGame.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository hosts a small variety of simple games written in Python using PyGame.
They are small projects that are targeted towards beginners, and as such the projects will not be exceedingly complex.
The final release of the game will be a single file not exceeding 500 lines of code.

For some of the games, various stages of development can be found. The versions are organised into versions (game-v#.#.#).
The final release is the latest version, typically v1.0.0.

An attempt will be made to include basic documentation throughout the code, however due to the intended simplicity of this
project, it will be kept to only what is necessary.
